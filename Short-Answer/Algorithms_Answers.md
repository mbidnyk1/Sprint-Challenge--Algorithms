#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
    If n > 0 input size n is going to always be bigger than a by n. So at worst it'll loop over one more time and it'll do this constantly no matter how large the input which is O(1) time complexity.

b)
    The first loop is O(n) because each operation increases linearly based on input size. The second, while loop, is also O(n) for the same reason so in total this is O(n^2) time complexity.

c)
    The function is being called recursively n times before reaching the base case so its O(n).
